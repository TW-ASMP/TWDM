The following is the complete set of Toronto Water's work type classification.

* corrective
* emergency [^1]
* investigative
* preventive
* informational
* project
* capital project support

## Notes
[^1]: An emergency work order is technically a corrective work that must be done urgently; may also involve an investigative component (not unlike other corrective work orders).
