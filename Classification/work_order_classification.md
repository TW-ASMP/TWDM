[^1]: Technically a piece of corrective work that must be done urgently; may also involve an investigative component (not unlike other corrective work orders).
[^2]: 8/12: "commissioining" work type is added after discussion with Debbie. The think is that this would formalize the process of new asset onboarding, and ensure that we accurately record the "first day of operation" of assets.
