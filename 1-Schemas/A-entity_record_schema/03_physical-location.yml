      This field allows the user to specify whether the physical-location is merely specified, or whether the boundary enclosing the physical-location have been contructed (or alternatively, the fiat property / or area boundary around is formally established and approved.) - i.e. "exists".
      Note that an "eliminated" physical-location should be removed from the hierarchy, and should not be visible for users conducting maintenance, reliability, planning and scheduling functions.
      The term "eliminated" is chosen to indicate that physical-location disappear by the fact that object bound or defined the physical-location, such as wall, ceilings, or property lines are removed.
