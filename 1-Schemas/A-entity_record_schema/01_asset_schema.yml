      UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when onboarding assets from another system or a spreadsheet, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.

      This field will be populated by a rule processor, either inside Maximo or operating outside with integration to Maximo. An example of the inferred class is "high-pressure boiler".  The values are strings instead of classification objects because the inferred classes will not be in Maximo's asset classification. It is only found in the ontology.

      - abandoned in place

    $comment: |
      This data field is not nullable becauase the lack of knowledge is explicitly expressed as "missing" or "lost", and the non-existence is expressed as "planned" or "removed from possession".

  operating state:
    type: string

      - unavailable (down)  
      - not applicable
    $comment: |
      The "not applicable" value is being represented explicitly in the value list, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any role, organization, or anyone.

        This property is added to assist with the interpretation of the NULL value in "assigned to role", "assigned to user group", or "assigned to user group" property. If the property matches the selected value, then null means no knowledge; if the property does not match, then null means not applicable.

  #========================
  
  is a part of the larger asset:
    oneOf: [$ref: assetObject, type: null]
    updated by system: true
    $comment: |
      Though it is more elegant to represent the location of a part as the space of a larger asset, this would involve setting up a rule to automatically create a spatial location entity.  Though this is achievable in the work management system, it is not in every other system where we enter assets (e.g. EIW). Also, to always says that the asset is located in a space of a larger asset is not semantically correct. Sometimes, the asset is not so much "in" another asset then being "a part of" it.

      []RULE VkcDoPILgl #inference: This field is to be filled in by a script. The script should fill in the value of properties."asset name" value of the highest-level <discrete asset>, which this asset is a part of.

    oneOf: [$ref: serviceAddress, type: null]

  parent asset:
    oneOf: [$ref: assetObject, type: null]
    description: >
      The value in this property denotes the larger discrete asset or defined collection of assets, to which this asset is a part of.  NOTE: this property is not meant to be used for specifying the system hierarchy parent. That property is found on the role record, not the asset record. 
    $comment: |
      This field is commonly used when the asset is a part of a skid, structural tank, or switchgear cabinet, in which the asset parent in the system hierarchy should be the line entity. As such we will using this field to track that the asset is also a part of a phyical assembly.  We would also be using this field to capture a serialized rotating component as a part of another discrete asset. This field can also be used to indicate an asset membership in a Defined Collection of Assets.

  first day of City operation:
    oneOf: [type: string, type: null]
    $comment: |
      This usually coincides with "warranty start date".  However, if the asset is not delivered through a project, "warranty start date" may be empty.

  # , it behaves just like a assets, you are simplying tracking its movement(transaction)
  

  #========================

  OEM serial:
    oneOf: [type: string, type: null]
    description: The serial number, affixed on the asset, designated by the manufacturer.
    $comment: |
      Outcome of TH's discussion within ASMP: The serial number is only populated when an asset experiences a movement (except for movement for removal), or when it is being check into a storeroom.
      Therefore, when the value of the OEM serial is null, it represents the fact that we do not know what the serial number is (and whether it has a serial number at all).
