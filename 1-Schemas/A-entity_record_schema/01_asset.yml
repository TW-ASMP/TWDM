        $comment: |
          UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when onboarding assets from another system or a spreadsheet, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.

      - not applicable
    $comment: |
      To data architect and implementer: the "not applicable" value is important, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any role, functional_group, or anyone.

      This field is commonly used when the asset is a part of a skid, structural tank, or switchgear cabinet, in which the asset parent in the system hierarchy should be the line entity. As such we will using this field to track that the asset is also a part of a physical assembly.

This field can also be used to indicate an asset membership in a Defined Collection of Assets.
