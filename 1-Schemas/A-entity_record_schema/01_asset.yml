      This data field is not nullable because the lack of knowledge is explicitly expressed as "missing" or "lost", and the non-existence is expressed as "planned" or "removed from possession".

  operating_state:

      - not applicable
    $comment: |
      To data architect and implementer: the "not applicable" value is important, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any functional-location, org-chart_group, or anyone.

    $comment: |
      This field is commonly used when the asset is a part of a skid, structural tank, or switchgear cabinet, in which the asset parent in the system hierarchy should be the line entity. As such we will using this field to track that the asset is also a part of a physical assembly. We would also be using this field to capture a serialized rotating component as a part of another discrete asset. This field can also be used to indicate an asset membership in a Defined Collection of Assets.

"true" value would designate the asset as a rotating tool, which allows the asset to be 1. reserved for work, or 2. assigned to a staff or group (which includes fixed tools).
    $comment: Note that this property was changed from "mobile" because this designation also applies to fixed tools, such as machine shop or lab tools. All of these assets fall within the definition of a tool.

      ASMP Discussion Log: The serial number is only populated when an asset experiences a movement (except for movement for removal), or when it is being check into a storeroom. Therefore, when the value of the OEM_serial is null, it represents the fact that we do not know what the serial number is (and whether it has a serial number at all).

      Note that this property is populated automatically, and not available for user to edit. Use-case: asset from the GIS will not be indexed on the hierarchy. The main use of this property is to provide a simple handle term, when one needs to summarize the collection of all assets imported from a certain layer(s) the GIS.
