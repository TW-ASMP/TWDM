        $comment: |
          UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when onboarding assets from another system or a spreadsheet, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.

      This field will be populated by a rule processor, likely operation outside of Maximo and with integration to Maximo. An example of the inferred class is "high-pressure boiler".

      The "not applicable" value is being represented explicitly in the value list, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any role, organization, or anyone.

OPEN AND TODO ITEMS: |
  []  - add RULE: asset can be assigned to an asset collection and a group or a person at the same time (though it cannot be assigned to a discrete asset role and a group at the same time)

  [] - Need to have a different set of data entry (i.e. what is NULLable) requirement for Linear assets
  
  [] (April 26 Review) the ability to assigned to a vehicle is missing - it should be considered as a satellite storeroom
        ANS: May 6th: TH: I am covering this with the existing property "installation or storage location"
