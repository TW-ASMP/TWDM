      - specified
      - active

    description: |
      This is the basic life-cycle status of a role. Specified means the role is conceived and exists in some specification or design documentation. Active means the necessary supports exist for an asset to serve in the role and function of the asset being utilized. Eliminated represents a negation of either or both conditions of the active status.
    TW_rule: |
      #[]RULE VkiDyJcSxg: Before a role can be eliminated, all children, as well as the decendents of the role in the hierarachy must also be eliminated. 
        $comment: a procedure should to be created to allow the recursive elimination of a role and all of its children. 
      #[]RULE VygDC0Frxl: When a role is "eliminated", it must no longer be visible in any view of the role hierarchy. (Its entire branch must not be available either, because all of its decendents would be eliminated as well.)
        []Review with To ASMP: with this rule, we no longer need to have a hierarchy branched for retired roles.   
      #[]RULE EkP5qy5Sxl: If change auditing cannot be turned on, then when a role record status is "eliminated", all the specification in the record's datafields must be frozen.

  role technical requirement description:
    type: string
    description: A free text description of the role's performance requirements that must be satisfied by the asset. For example, the lifting capacity in kilograms for a crane.

      Eventually, this information should be replaced by formalized properties associated with specific role classes. For example, for the motor role class, there would be a requirement for a minimum amount of horsepower or torque.

  OPEN AND TODO ITEMS:
    [x] To have discussion on what we put in for criticality
    [] explicitly specify an unoccupied role
    [] expression of role equivalence
    [] RULE: certain GIS assets, such as pumping stations, or treatment facilities must be mapped over as roles
