    $comment: |
      "specified" means the functional-location is conceived and exists in some specification or design documentation; "active" means the necessary supports exist for an asset to serve in the functional-location and function of the asset being utilized; "eliminated" represents a negation of either or both conditions of the active status.

    #[]RULE VkiDyJcSxg: Before a functional-location can be eliminated, all children, as well as the descendants of the functional-location in the hierarchy must also be eliminated. $comment: a procedure should to be created to allow the recursive elimination of a functional-location and all of its children.

    #[]RULE VygDC0Frxl: When a functional-location is "eliminated", it must no longer be visible in any view of the functional-location hierarchy. (Its entire branch must not be available either, because all of its descendants would be eliminated as well.)
    #[]Review with To ASMP: with this rule, we no longer need to have a hierarchy branched for retired functional-locations.

    #[]RULE EkP5qy5Sxl: If change auditing cannot be turned on, then when a functional-location record status is "eliminated", all the specification in the record's data fields must be frozen.

    #[]RULE:
    # IN COMMON LANGUAGE: At any given time, each functional-location may only have a single asset assigned to it (i.e., associated with the functional-location via the asset's "assigned_to_functional_location" property).
