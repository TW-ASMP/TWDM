[^1]: Under this category, you will find terms denoting discrete assets that perform a low-level technical functions, which can be put to use in systems that achieve a more diverse range of human goals 
[^2]: Under the other sub-categories of asset, you will find terms denoting discrete and collection assets (used in systems) that achieves a narrow and closed range of human goal.
[^3]: Sometimes the distinction between "discrete general purpose asset" and "specific purpose asset" is not a clear-cut. In these cases, you will a class under both categories.
