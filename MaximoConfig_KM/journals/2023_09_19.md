### [[üß†to keep in mind]]: How should assets not in a role be indexed and found

	- These assets include
		- tools and mobile assets
		- assets in a distribution or distributed network
	- Tools and mobile assets should be index to a space and a work group (their user)
	- Assets on distribution or distributed network technically still have roles (the relationship between the role is just not conducive for hierarchal representation)

- Followup thoughts on ((6509b39d-12e0-4951-80ca-f39b2b2191db))
	- We could consider the a new state called "deleted", which implies that as of the moment of state change, we know that the asset does not exist.
	- To be more specific Deleted Record implies
		- Asset Not Found, which further implies
			- Never received - i.e. it had never existed
			- Cannot find / lost track - i.e. it may have existed, but it is now missing.
	- I think documentation of the deeper level of implications should be optional, as this information is not always available.

- ### [[üë©üèª‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èdecision]] on what data fields go to record attribute and what goes to class specification

	- any data field that is potentially applicable to instances of any class (or indefinitely set of classes) should be at the asset attribute level. By this reasoning, Product-line information should be on the attributes.
	- any data field that is applicable to a definite set of classes (or natural asset classes, like pump, motor etc.) should be represented as a specification.
