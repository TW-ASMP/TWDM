  review-on-date::
	- GI raise FSTP wants to integrate cost from Maximo into SAP. This had been raised to Faisel, and GI had been brought into the conversation.
	- Our Fear:
		- their system of inventory management do not suit our use-case.
	- Our Hope:
		- we can come up with something useful, and they would be receptive to adopt.
	- The Opportunity:
		- If FSTP adopts reasonable representation for material management, this would be a huge step forward for SAP integration, of not only Toronto Water, but for the entire City.
	- The Risk:
		- If FSTP is not open minded in adopting a better representation, but
	- Next Step:
		- NOW take up with Annette of whether to adopt this as the 3rd use-case. But before this, we should get a gauge of possibility that this would stick.
