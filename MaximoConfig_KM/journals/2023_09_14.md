### [[🤝🏻meeting note]]
initiative::
notable-attendees:: [[Silvia]]
	- Debbie's Implementation of my Asset Schema into Maximo
		- Rule: Linear will overwrite the asset ID auto generation (TWAG)
		- Interesting fact Silvia raised: There will be assets that linear want to complete the work right away, they want to create asset they discover in the WMS first, and have added to TWAG.
			- Me: we need 2-way integration.
		- I have noticed that in the classification breadcrumb, some classes must appear as acronyms, but in the tree, you can see the full name.
