acronyms:: TH - Tony, DM - Debbie
	- DM:
		- PM Option 1 is definitely off the table
			- TH added: unlike job plans, we cannot make the tasks re-usable.
				- DM: it will require *a lot of* scripting to change this
		- PM Option 2 is definitely the way to go.
	- DM: The biggest issue with PM Option 2 that comes to mind is "sequencing" (Maximo term on how a given PM's triggering affects another)
		- The most relevant case (raised by the plants) or instance is allowing a 1-year PM (PM-1)'s trigger to affect a 5-year PM (PM-5)'s behaviour
			- Options for handling
				- 1. Specify Coincidence
					- Remove all PM-1's jobs plan list from PM-5's job plan list
					- Specify PM-1 and PM-5 to trigger together
				- 1. Specify Conditional Inhibition
					- Tying the PM-1 and PM-5 together
					- Specify that when PM-5 triggers, we will inhibit PM-1's triggering
			- DM on possible issues:
				- we need to encode these in rules
				- We might need to develop a custom UI to edit and review these rules
	- ## On other topics
		- #[[ðŸ’¡insight]] #[[ðŸ§ to keep in mind]] - When we are reporting on the performance of legislative work, we should be reporting on whether individual legislative activities were performed within a particular time frame.  We should NOT focus on the Av-Task level.  Implication: A 5-year PM may inhibit the triggering of a 1-year PM, we nevertheless perform a certain required legislative activity (Act1), because it is specified in both the 1-year and the 5-year PM.
