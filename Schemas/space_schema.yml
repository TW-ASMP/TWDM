      This the name given to the space, without any content in reference to the larger spaces that contains this space. The incremental name will be last segment of the "space name" text.

      This name is not editable.  It is generated by the system, by concatenting the incremental name to the space name of the parent.

      This field allows the user to specify whether the space is merely specified, or whether the boundary enclosing the space have been contructed (or alternatively, the fiat property / or area boundary around is formally established and approved.) - i.e. "exists".
      Note that an "eliminated" space should be removed from the hierarchy, and should not be visible for users conducting maintenance, reliability, planning and scheduling functions.
      The term "eliminated" is chosen to indicate that space disappear by the fact that object bound or defined the space, such as wall, ceilings, or property lines are removed.
