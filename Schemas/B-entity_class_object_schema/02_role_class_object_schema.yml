      []RULE NJQ6BwsVee: A asset must be an instance of one of classes listed in this field to be allowed to occupy a role under this class. 

  "appliable":
    $comment: if appliable = false, the class is meant to be a structural part of the classifcation tree only, and cannot be used to classify any role.  e.g. a class named "linear system role"
  
  "discrete asset role":
    description: any role classified as a subclass of Discrete Asset Role. 
    $comment: this may seem redundant, but is added in case recursive rules (i.e. asset can only occupy subclasses of discrete asset role) is hard to write in Maximo.

    type: boolean

      []req VyJoYy0Hel: a retired class should not appear in the list of classes for user selection. Also, it's properties."appliable" value must be false.

    [] - GI: in the UI for class selection, it would be nice to see the parent class.
