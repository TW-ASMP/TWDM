  "appliable":
    $comment: if appliable = false, the class is meant to be a structural part of the classifcation tree only, and cannot be used to classify any role.  e.g. a class named "linear system role"
  
  "discrete asset role":
      $comment: this may seem redundant, but is added in case recursive rules (i.e. asset can only occupy subclasses of discrete asset role) is hard to write in Maximo.
