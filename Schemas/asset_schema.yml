      an asset is mobile if while it is in commission, it does not perform its function in a permanent installation
      instead, it is taken from place to place.

      Note that this field is populated automatically, and not available for user to edit. 
      Use-case: asset from the GIS will not be indexed on the hierarchy. The main use of this datafield is to provide a simple handle term, when one needs to summarize the collection of all assets imported from the GIS.

    $comment: >
      Aside from the example DOS maintaining asset operated by the plant. It is prudent to differentiate the maintnenance group from the operations group. We can imagine that in the next re-organization, there could be an operation department and a maintenance department in each plant. And each department could have its own workAreas / crews. 
  
  "assigned to operations group":
    $ref: .objectDefs/organization

      IMPORTANT: 
      we often think of operator should be an business unit, but it would be more optimal if we can assign a smaller group, such as a work area or a crew that is under a business unit in the org chart - essentially at the level of direct responsibility over the asset. Now this would only work well if we have a organization chart built into Maximo.
      For assets associated with roles, the operator can often be inferred from the role

  "first day of operation":
    type: string
    description: the date the asset came on site.
    $comment: >
      7/24: changed to "first day of operation" from "date received". As it is much easier to collect the first day of operation from mandatory work order transaction that captures commissioning / asset turnover or beginning of operation. This is also a more important date for gauging when warranty begins.

  "year of manufacture":

    description: the year the asset was made

      !!! IMPORTANT !!!
      This property is not meant to be use for specifying the asset hierarchy parent.
      What we conventionally call "asset hierarchy" in will be build with cascading roles.
      This property is to be used to express that an asset is a part of a trackable assembly, which has physical unity.

      These properties pertaining to the location of an asset are mutually exclusive.
      The first two lines say that a asset with locatedInSpace specification is not installed in a role
        With this rule, we avoid conflicting location information between present asset's locatedInSpace property 
        and its roles's locatedInSpace property

  # RULE IN ENGLISH: if a discrete asset is installed (not mobile) and in-use, then it must have a role specification
  - if:
    properties:
        mobileAsset:
          - const: FALSE
        operatingState:
          - const: "in use"
    then:
      required: role

  # RULE IN ENGLISH: if an asset is mobile and it is in use, then it must have a role specification

        - const: TRUE
      operatingState:

    then:

  # RULE IN ENGLISH: if lifeStatus property is either "planned" or "removed from TW",
    # Operating State must be empty or NULL i.e. we'd never expect there to be any value

  Additional rules in plan English
    1. if asset is from GIS, the asset record ID would be the GIS'sID. This is to be taken care of in the data import process.
    2. validation role: RoleClassification must be "Unit Asset" or "Asset Collection", and must not be a system role.
