  "asset ID":
    type: string
    description: A read-only UUID, generated by the system, to uniquely identify the asset record.
    $comment: >
      #PROCESS: UUID
        Upon the creation of a new asset record, insert UUID Version 4 value
      #PROCESS: GIS UID
        Upn the creation of a new asset record brought over from the TWAG, use the unique TWAG "Facility ID".
      --  
      Notes to TW: 
      - UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when we are onboarding an asset in GIS, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.
      - UUID also guarantees uniqueness, if we are trying to merge records from multiple systems.
      - We would prefer GIS and all other system producing asset information to use the UUID.

      The value in this field denotes the group responsible for the overall maintenance of the asset. For example, a Work Area that is responsible for the preventive maintenance and reactive maintenance (i.e., repair) of a given asset (and the larger system that contains the asset). 
    $comment: >  
      Note that a contractor is usually not a valid value in this field. Instead, the field should contain an owner's group, responsible for planning, arranging, overseeing the contractor's work.  An contractor could be a valid, however, it is responsible for all of the functions above.
      In cases in which, multiple internal groups are responsible for the asset's maintenance or repair, the field may contain the higher-level encompassing group, such D&C, instead  D&C-PM or D&C-Central Services.

  TASKS:
    [] For every property's enum, make sure their spellings are consistent everything
    [] Review Track: fields
    [] Review NULL assignment
    [] review .IBM_Maximo_object in object reference
    [] update the list of required fields to inlcude newly added ones
    [] consistenty apply reason for record retirement 
    [] change the specification of SUPPORTING MINOR OBJECT DEFINITION to 2 dimensional arrays
  
  =========================================

  OPEN AND TODO ITEMS:
    [] - RULE bOqnNS may be incorrect: for smaller assets, we may not need mfr or serial, but we may still need the asset record to keep track of condition.

    [] - specify field photos

    [] - rule on location inheritance from role

    [] - OPEN ISSUE from Debbie: How to characterized the criticality of a role / asset? (We do not have to unpack all dimensions of criticality, but the dimensions that will influence the planning or work)

    [] - Is there cases in which an installed asset do not have a role, may be something like a fire door, or a motion sensor. One reason that we do not role is that we do not need to track the replacement of these assets. If assets do not have role, we would be tracking them by space are in, the space they serve, or by the group or person that they are assigned to. 
    
    [] - Need to have a different set of data entry (i.e. what is nullable) requirement for Linear assets
    
    [] (April 26 Review) reflect condition in the schema
    
    [] (April 26 Review) assigned to a vehicle is missing - this is a satellite storeroom
          ANS: May 6th: TH: I am covering this with the existing property "located in space"
  
    [] RULE: a general requirement to print error messages

  ================================================

  REVIEW ITEMS (incl completed open items:):

    [N/A] Discussion intention: 
      - for the implementation, we need to fully realize at least one type of activity as a transaction (or pure function) that changes the state of a property of a record. I suggest configuring the following:
        - given the completion of any activity, present the options to change the condition and the availability state of the asset.
        - given the completion of an subclasse of "move and replace" activity, the asset's location and/or physical State should be changed by the transaction
      
    [N/A] Disucussion:
      - Do we want the option to have separate groups being represented for routine maintenace vs reactive maintnenace. Like in D&C. 

    [OPEN] RULE: (May 10 Review) rule suggestion: an asset going into storage should not be assigned to any role or any one.
      [?] Annette,
        Would you want to impmement a) spaces designated for storage or b) real maximo store rooms. Note that option a) seems simple, but involves some complexity for representing assets that are used inside a storage space. (Despite the fact they are inside the storage spaces, they may still be assigned to a role or someone and may still need to be maintained.)

    [V] RULE: check only one asset can be assigned to a role
    
    [?] - Need to incorporate information about ownership from TWAG (whether it is City, private,)
      [] Tony to engage feedback: 
        - Review the two options for "asset owner organization"
        - To take up the proposal of using universal metadata for the value list.
    
    [V] RULE: if from GIS then populate GeoID
      datafield "TWAG asset" is added for this purpose
    
    [V] I separated "privately owned" as its own datafield, with the intent to avoid the confusion
    
    [?] Candice: what does private ownership mean? It is owned by a private citizen or organization or both?

    [V] (April 26 Review) How do we name "non-manufactured" assets? 
          PL: follow what PCS stand is doing. TH: structural asset is the majority and they can be named like a role.
          [] lets review: 
            Do we need to have the year in which it is constructed. I think so, in reporting, it helps to identify the identify of the asset, among a series in history serving in the same role. 

    [?] - OPEN ISSUE from Debbie: Will true “safety” be identified on an asset record (hazards, precautions, loto)?
      Consider adding the one of the following sub-schema the the asset schema. Note the all fields would be populated by the legislative compliance reasoner.
