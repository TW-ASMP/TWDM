    description: A description of the role, in terms of its relations to its parent role and the roles that it presently serves
    # MT []: would you like me to move this into individual roles?

    description: the parent role

    description: this field specifies the class of asset that is suppose to occupy this role
    $comment: >
      this field allow the user to specify what the equipment does in the system instead of what the equipment is. For example, for generators, instead of 
        * generator
          * diesel generator
          * natural gas generator
      we would have
        * generator role
          * emergenecy generator role
          * backup generator role

  "discrete asset role":
    type: boolean
    inferred: true
    $comment: this field is update by the system (i.e., properties.inferred is true). The value is true, if the class value is a sub-class of discrete asset role in the role classification hierarchy.

  "status":
    type: string
    track: TRUE
    enum:
      - "specified"
      - "realized"
      - "eliminated"
    $comment: >
      This field allows the user to specify whether the role is merely a concept in the design stage -i.e., equivalent to "planned" for assets, or whether the system around the role and supports for asset occupying the it have been contructed - i.e. "realized".
      Note that an "eliminated" role should be removed from the hierarchy, and should not be visible for users conducting maintenance, reliability, planning and scheduling functions.

  "duty standby designation":
    type:

  #========================

  "serves role":
    $ref: .objectDefs/role
    description: >
      Specifies the role (more precisely the asset serving in the role), that this role is serving. For example, if the present role is that of a valve, then its client may be a pump.

  "role technical requirement description":
    type: string
    $comment: >
      A free text description of the performance requirements of the role. 
      For example, weight in kg for a lifting device.
      Eventually, this should be formalized as properties of the specific role class. For example horsepower for motor class
      # For now, this can be entered as a free text

$comment: >
  OPEN AND TODO ITEMS:
    [] explicitly specify an unoccupied asset
    
    [] expression of role equivalence
  
    [] expression of central role in a system
  
    []  - commissioning date should be written into the record of the asset and the role.

    []  - certain GIS assets, such as pumping stations, or treatment facilities must be mapped over as roles
  
    [] Discrete asset role cannot be the parent of a collection of roles.
