## Footnotes:
[^1]: Sometimes the distinction between "discrete general purpose asset" and "specific purpose asset" is not a clear-cut. In these cases, you will a class under both categories.
[^2]: Under this category, you will find terms denoting discrete assets that perform a low-level technical function, which can be put to use in systems designed to achieve a diverse range of human goals 
[^3]: Under the categories below, you will find terms denoting discrete and system assets that achieves a specific human goal or that plays a role in a system designed for achieving a specific human goal.
